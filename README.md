Week 6 Project:  Build a Social Network

Overview:
//Use Express and Sequelize to build a social network for students. This network, called "Gabble," has users, public messages, and likes.

1)Users should:
//have a username and password for logging in
//have a display name

2)Messages should:
//be associated with a user who wrote them
//have up to 140 characters of text

3)Likes should:
//be associated with a user who made the like and a message that was liked

4)The application should have ways to do the following:
              (**See Mockups in Newline**)
//Sign up as a new user
//Log in
//Log out
//View all messages with the newest first
//Create a new message
//Delete one of your own messages
//Like a message
//See who liked a message

5)Needs:
This will require your knowledge of:
//forms,
//validation,
//sessions,
//middleware,
//Sequelize.

//pages: homepage, sign up, log in, create a new gab, see list of likes,
**You will likely have to look up some features of these.**

**You may want to consider running sequelize seed:create and create a new seed file that will create several users and gabs.**
